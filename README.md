# TF_course_assignments
I took a basic course in Tensorflow 2.0. The purpose of this project is not to relearn Machine Learning, but for other goals which will be discussed later.

# Courses I will be taking (in sequential order)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-with-tensorflow-for-business-intelligence/)
* [Data Handling](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-sql-for-data-analysis-with-google-bigquery/)

## Learning Objectives
* Write Code for others
  * Improve readability
  * More useful documentation
* Team Alignment
  * Getting used to tensorflows everchanging syntax.
  * Familiarizing myself with data handling and visualization
